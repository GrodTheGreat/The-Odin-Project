# The Odin Project

This repo is meant to hold all the files for my learning of the Odin Project. Technically I am breaking the rules slightly since I am meant to have separate repos for the lessons and projects to build git experience, but I already have that and I just can't be bothered. 

Each folder is meant to be the various lessons, although not every lesson requires code so not every lesson is here.
